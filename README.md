# Boston-Housing-Price-Forecasting-Model

### Goal
I will apply advanced machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. I will first explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset as well as eliminating outliers. Next, data will be splited using cross validation into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. Performance graphs and a learning algorithm with varying parameters will be designed to find the optimal arguments in order to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, testing will be performed this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to our statistics.
 
This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

### Knowledge applied in this project:
- How to use NumPy to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
- How to analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias.
- How to determine the best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
- How to evaluate a model's performance on unseen data using previous data.

### Highlights of this project:
1. Decision Tree Algorithm using Scikit-Learn
2. Cross Validation
3. Learning Curve to examine training and validation scores
4. Grid Search and Shuffle Methods to find optimal kernal and max_depth argument
5. Performance Metrics Examination
6. Numpy and Panda toolkits for data processing
7. Visualition in Python using Matplotlib

### This project contains two files:

- `boston_housing.ipynb`: This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project.
- `housing.csv`: The project dataset. You'll load this data in the notebook.


### Install

Depending on the enviroment, you may need to install the following packages in python in order to successfully run this project:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
